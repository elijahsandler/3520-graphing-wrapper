# 3520-nn-project

## Overview
This project contains a UI for the Matplot++ graphing library, and is specifically focused on plotting geographical data (hence the name "GeoGrapher", which I thought was funny).

## External Libraries
- [Matplot++](https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus "Matplot++")
  - Matplot++ requires [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/ "gnuplot"), which looks like a virus, but isn't
- [Commata](https://github.com/furfurylic/commata "Commata"), a header only library for reading CSVs
  - Requires C++17
